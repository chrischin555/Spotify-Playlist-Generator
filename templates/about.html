    <h1>About Game-Play</h1>
    <h2>What is Game-Play?</h2>
    <p>
    Game-Play is an application that utilizes Spotipy, a Python library for Spotify's Web API and OpenAI's API to generate
    playlists curated for gamers.<br>
    It works by taking the title of a game from the user's Steam library (which utilizes Spotify's Steam API for Python)<br>
    and takes the information about the game (the name of the game and the genre of the game). <br>
    OpenAI uses the name of the game and the genre to find songs that match the vibe of the game. <br>
    Users can view details about the song (artist, album, release date) and can listen to a preview of that song. <br>
    Users can add the songs they like to a playlist. That playlist can be added to their Spotify account, allowing 
    users to listen to the songs recommended by our application at their convenience.
